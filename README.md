# automata-playground

Playground for cellular automata made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Includes code for Conway's Game of Life, WireWorld, Rule 90 and Brian's Brain, although other automatas can be added by appending it's name and logic to the `automatas` object of `automata.js`.

The `index.html` file can be executed with no external dependencies.
